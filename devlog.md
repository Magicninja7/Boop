This is a devlog for this 3d printer im making!
(im keeping this casual)

# Day 0 (25.05.25)
Today i did research, setup fusion, and started making a scetch for the base!
After that, i started making the polar mechanism itself, designing the gears and belt. Now if gear A (the small one) is spun, gear B spins too. On the left, seperated for now, is a part of the printbed and elemesnts allowing it to spin (atleast they will in the future).

# Day 1 & 2 (27 & 29.05.2025)
With exams, i didn't have time to do much. I did do one thing though, draw out the design on my whiteboard. I also found a good extruder to use (sherpa mini), paired with the XC1 hotend and a dragon burner. I have already gotten the cads for them, and only need to assemble them within fusion.
And more research on how to do the z axis. The problem with the design in the video, is that it shakes, and like a lot. To solve it, im considering adding another arm, on the other side of the cartridge. This would substantially minimalise shaking, but slightly increase the price. I think its a good trade, as the other way involves getting rid on the cantileverian design.
