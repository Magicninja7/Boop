This is a devlog for this 3d printer im making!
(im keeping this casual)

# Day 0 (24-25.05.25) ~15 hours
Today i did research, setup fusion, and started making a scetch for the base!
After that, i started making the polar mechanism itself, designing the gears and belt. Now if gear A (the small one) is spun, gear B spins too. On the left, seperated for now, is a part of the printbed and elemesnts allowing it to spin (atleast they will in the future).

# Day 1 & 2 (27 & 29.05.2025) ~2.5 hours
With exams, i didn't have time to do much. I did do one thing though, draw out the design on my whiteboard. I also found a good extruder to use (sherpa mini), paired with the XC1 hotend and a dragon burner. I have already gotten the cads for them, and only need to assemble them within fusion.
And more research on how to do the z axis. The problem with the design in the video, is that it shakes, and like a lot. To solve it, im considering adding another arm, on the other side of the cartridge. This would substantially minimalise shaking, but slightly increase the price. I think its a good trade, as the other way involves getting rid on the cantileverian design.


# Day 3 (13.06.2025) ~0 hours lmao
Thank god i passed everything, finally have got time to continue this project. 

# Day 4 (20.06.2025) ~3 hours
I completed the whole extruder part, by using the sherpa mini with the xc1 hotend, combined with the dragon burner. Starting on the x axis, i have completed the design on paper, now i only need to bring it onto fusion. I also will be using a 2x sliding rods, and 2x lead screws for the y axis, but i will add that after i finish the x axis.

# Day 5 (21.06.2025) ~5 hours
Im continuing my work on the x axis. Found and added pulleys needed for the design (6 total), added the vrail and carriage). All designed by me, its why it took soo long

# Day 6 (25.06.2025)
Today i added a pulley at the end of the vrail (it isnt connected yet tho, im yet to do that). I also added a second pulley at the other end, it will be moving the extruder. In here, i created a part that will hold it, it fit snugggly into the vrail, with 0.1mm margin. It also will have a whole in the middle (through the whole thing, including the vrail), to slide in a blot, so the whole thing doesnt move or shake. It also has 2 ball bearings, with inside diamater of 20mm, the same as the pulley.
