This is a devlog for this 3d printer im making!
(im keeping this casual)

# Day 0 (25.05.25)
Today i did research, setup fusion, and started making a scetch for the base!
After that, i started making the polar mechanism itself, designing the gears and belt. Now if gear A (the small one) is spun, gear B spins too. On the left, seperated for now, is a part of the printbed and elemesnts allowing it to spin (atleast they will in the future).
